# Reflective Essay 2 — Bus Stop Merge & Optimization

In drafting our government enquiry and developing the Bus Stop Merge project, I learned how data-driven methods shape practical urban planning decisions. Our team focused on whether merging closely spaced stops (e.g., 25m apart) improves operational efficiency without unduly harming accessibility. The roadmap required combining spatial analysis, ridership data collection, and modeling — tasks that exposed gaps between ideal models and available public data.

Writing the formal enquiry to the Transport Department taught me crucial lessons about government data access. I learned to craft precise requests under the Code on Access to Information, specifically asking for bus stop utilization data (hourly passenger counts, peak times, demographic patterns) and accessibility metrics for elderly residents. Through multiple drafts, I discovered the importance of justifying each data request by linking it to public interest - explaining how merger decisions could affect elderly residents' daily commutes. The experience revealed that while some data is public on data.gov.hk, detailed operational data requires formal requests with clear research purposes.

AI-assisted drafting helped structure professional language and check for completeness, though identifying the right data variables relied on subject knowledge and team discussion. The experience taught me to balance technical modeling plans with realistic data access strategies, and to prepare fallback plans when requests are denied. Overall, this project improved my skills in formal communication, collaborative modeling, and pragmatic problem-solving for evidence-based policy recommendations.
