# Reflective Essay 2 — Bus Stop Merge & Optimization

In drafting our government enquiry and developing the Bus Stop Merge project, I learned how data-driven methods shape practical urban planning decisions. Our team focused on whether merging closely spaced stops (e.g., 25m apart) improves operational efficiency without unduly harming accessibility. The roadmap required combining spatial analysis, ridership data collection, and modeling — tasks that exposed gaps between ideal models and available public data.

Writing the formal enquiry under the Code on Access to Information sharpened my ability to specify precisely which datasets are needed (ridership by stop, origin-destination patterns, accessibility metrics). Crafting clear, justified requests revealed how government data infrastructures affect research feasibility: some high-resolution data appears only via formal request.

AI-assisted drafting helped structure professional language and check for completeness, though identifying the right data variables relied on subject knowledge and team discussion. The experience taught me to balance technical modeling plans with realistic data access strategies, and to prepare fallback plans when requests are denied. Overall, this project improved my skills in formal communication, collaborative modeling, and pragmatic problem-solving for evidence-based policy recommendations.
